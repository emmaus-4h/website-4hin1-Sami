              Electro has the following Elemental Reactions:<br><br>

            Overloaded: Deals AoE Pyro DMG and causes an explosion.<br>
            Hydro Electro-Charged: Deals Electro DMG over time and interrupts any action. If there are nearby Wet targets, they also get the Electro-Charged elemental reaction. Electro-Charged deals 2 instances of damage.<br>
            Cryo Superconduct: Deals AoE Cryo DMG and reduces the target's Physical DMG Resistance by -40%. The number of targets hit by Superconduct will affect how much damage it does. If it hits a single enemy, it will only hit once. If the AoE of Superconduct hits 5 enemies, it will strike those 5 enemies 5 times each.<br>
            Anemo Swirl: Infuses and deals Electro damage while spreading the effect to nearby enemies.<br>
            Geo Crystallize: Creates an Electro shield.Swirl: Infuses an element and deals that elemental damage while spreading the effect to nearby enemies. It does not deal Anemo damage (as that elemental damage seen comes from the talent that is dealing the Anemo element). Only one element at a time can be infused with Anemo.<br>
            Many Anemo characters and enemies also have the following skills:<br><br>

            Electro on its own does not have any special effect, but it will allow Electro Elemental Reactions to occur. Certain mechanics in Inazuma, such as the Lightning Strike Probe, will respond to characters or monsters affected by Electro.<br>
            Any source of Electro DMG, including Electro Crystals, will apply the Electro status. Getting struck by lightning or entering a body of water struck by lightning during a thunderstorm will also apply Electro.<br>
